            <img src="img/pic1.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Conflict is, in a series called Warcraft, an arguable necessity.
              But battles of good versus evil are never straightforward when
              cosmic deities meddle in the matters of mortals. When a fallen
              titan possessed of untold power and a desire to scour all life
              ordered the corruption of the orcs, they were set on a path that
              would end in an inevitable clash with a nation of humans enjoying
              a prosperous existence. This universe-spanning conflict helped
              forge Azeroth into the world we know it as today. Read on to
              relive the history of Warcraft and prepare yourself to take up
              arms in Warcraft III: Reforged.
            </p>
            <h2>Of Orcs and Humans in Warcraft</h2>
            <p>
              Once the greatest warrior of the godlike Titans—the assemblage of
              cosmic entities responsible for the shaping and ordering of the
              universe—Sargeras succumbed to the all-consuming corruption of the
              Twisting Nether, a plane between worlds composed of chaotic
              magics, and its resident fiends while attempting to shield his
              brethren from its depravity. Convinced that the only way to spare
              the universe from the Nether’s demonic entities was to purge it,
              he soon turned his power on the cosmos, seeking to cleanse all
              life in existence. To this end, he forged the demonic Burning
              Legion. After a failed attack on Azeroth 10,000 years ago,
              Sargeras saw an opportunity to once again strike at the world, and
              possessed the magus Medivh, intending to use his power to foment a
              war between worlds that would force Azeroth to buckle upon itself.
              Corrupted by the malignant magics of Sargeras, Medivh, the last of
              an ancient line of powerful magi and friend to the throne of
              Stormwind, worked to orchestrate Azeroth’s downfall. He found in
              the far-off world of Draenor a kindred spirit—the powerful warlock
              Gul’dan. Wielding heretical magic, this nefarious orc taught his
              brethren to channel demonic energy. His influence over the orcs
              came to a head when he convinced them to drink the blood of the
              demon Mannoroth, promising them invincibility in exchange for
              their compliance. The fiend’s blood poisoned their minds,
              transforming the orcs into an army consumed by bloodlust and
              controlled from the shadows by Gul’dan and his puppet Warchief,
              Blackhand. Medivh struck a deal with his new ally: in exchange for
              the promise of godhood, Gul’dan would create a gateway between the
              human homeworld of Azeroth and his own planet, Draenor. Thus, the
              Dark Portal was first opened, and the Horde flooded through to
              clash with the humans of Azeroth.
            </p>
            <img src="img/pic2.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              The orcish Horde assailed the humans’ heartlands, razing entire
              towns and leaving ruin in their wake. For years, orcs and humans
              clashed in savage skirmishes, each side biding their time and
              surveying the enemy with the intent to launch a full-force strike
              when the hour was right. Three years after the Dark Portal was
              opened, the Horde marched on Stormwind City. Though their first
              attack was repelled by the King’s Commander Anduin Lothar, the
              Horde retreated to regroup and decide how best to land a decisive
              blow against the human kingdom. Meanwhile, Medivh’s apprentice
              Khadgar confided in King Llane and Anduin Lothar, revealing that
              his master had been corrupted by dark forces and had unleashed the
              Horde upon Azeroth. With Khadgar’s aid, Lothar slew Medivh and
              banished the spirit of Sargeras within him to the Nether. Gul’dan,
              having entered Medivh’s mind prior to his death to scour it for
              information, fell into a deep coma after the magus’s death. The
              great orc chieftain Orgrim Doomhammer found himself disillusioned
              with the Horde’s leadership under Gul’dan and Blackhand. Sensing
              an opportunity, he challenged Blackhand for the mantle of Warchief
              and emerged from the fray victorious. United under the banner of
              Doomhammer, the Horde marched upon Stormwind once more. While the
              city was under siege, Garona Halforcen, a former ally of the
              humans who was secretly in the thrall of Gul’dan’s Shadow Council,
              secured victory for the orcs, and assassinated King Llane under
              the Council’s orders. The morale of Stormwind’s military died
              along with him, and the city fell to the might of the Horde.
              Anduin Lothar declared the war lost and retreated with the
              remnants of Stormwind’s populace across the Great Sea.
            </p>
            <h2>Warcraft II’s Turning Tides</h2>
            <p>
              Desperate for aid, Lothar and the survivors of Stormwind’s siege
              fled north. There, they sought support from the sovereign of the
              mighty human kingdom of Lordaeron, King Terenas Menethil II. The
              refugees were irrefutable proof of the threat posed by the Horde;
              unable to deny the existence of such a threat to life on Azeroth,
              King Terenas summoned the leaders of the human kingdoms to prepare
              a counteroffensive against the Horde. Seven nations united under a
              single banner for the first time in three thousand years, giving
              birth to the Alliance of Lordaeron. Gul’dan, recently awoken from
              his magical coma following the death of Medivh, bargained with the
              Horde’s new Warchief and disavowed the Shadow Council to spare his
              life. Though wary of the warlock, Doomhammer spared Gul’dan, and
              allowed him to establish his own clan to bolster the Horde’s
              ranks. With powerful aid in the form of conscripted Amani trolls
              and the recently discovered Demon Soul—an ancient artifact capable
              of controlling dragons—the orcs prepared to advance upon the
              remaining human nations. While the Horde readied themselves to
              march upon their enemies, Lothar rallied the disparate races of
              Lordaeron, gaining the aid of the dwarves of Ironforge and
              invoking his right as the last descendant of the Arathi line to
              call upon the high elves of Quel’Thalas. Bound by a blood oath
              sworn long ago to Lothar’s kin, King Anasterian Sunstrider sent a
              small force of soldiers to Lordaeron’s aid, first among them the
              Ranger-Captain Alleria Windrunner.
            </p>
            <img src="img/pic3.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Orgrim Doomhammer led his Horde north on a continued path of
              destruction, following the remnants of Stormwind’s people to
              Lordaeron and razing all that stood in his way. Though victory
              seemed in sight as the orcish forces marched on Lordaeron, the
              city would live to withstand the latter days of the Second War by
              virtue of discord within the Horde’s ranks. Doomhammer and his
              army, poised to strike at the heart of the Alliance, received dire
              news: Gul’dan had abandoned his fellow orcs, taking with him half
              of their military might to seek out the fabled Tomb of Sargeras in
              his pursuit of godhood. Gul’dan’s betrayal afforded the Alliance
              the very chance it needed to turn the tide of war. Anduin Lothar’s
              troops rallied and pushed the Horde from the lands of Lordaeron
              all the way down to the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire.
              Unwilling to accept defeat, the determined Doomhammer landed one
              final blow upon the humans, putting an end to Lothar’s life in a
              suicidal charge. As Lothar fell, his lieutenant Turalyon took up
              the mantle of commander, calling upon his brothers and sisters to
              persevere and fight on in honor of their commander’s legacy. So
              inspirational was his battle cry that the human forces fervently
              cleaved through the Horde, scattering its army and seizing those
              they could find as prisoners of the Alliance. Those who were
              caught were herded into internment camps and left to wallow. And
              so, the flames of the Second War guttered out, and peace settled
              upon a land that had for so long been plagued by war. In the years
              following the Horde’s defeat, the Alliance splintered, no longer
              held together by the tenuous covenant that had been forged out of
              common desperation. Thus, the Kingdom of Lordaeron was left to
              face alone an uncertain future.

            <h2>Chaos Rising</h2>
            <p>
              As Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos begins, nearly 13 years after the
              Horde’s defeat, trouble stirs once again. Rumors of a plague
              spread quickly through the kingdom of Lordaeron, unsettling the
              citizenry and prompting King Terenas’s son, Arthas, to investigate
              its source—a venture that will set him on a dark path and forever
              define his fate. Meanwhile, a young upstart rallies the orcs that
              have spent the past decade laboring in crowded internment camps,
              inspiring them to cast off the yoke of imprisonment and once more
              take up their blades. Within Alliance-ruled lands, a cult arises,
              poisoning the minds of its members and heralding the start of an
              insidious scourge that seeks to pave the way for a new invasion of
              Azeroth. And the Night Elves, desperate to protect their ancient
              homelands from destructive forces, awaken their dreaming kin and
              contemplate freeing the most dangerous prisoner their kind has
              ever known, in a bid for the power necessary to stand against
              their enemies. Calamity returns once more to the world of
              Warcraft, and its inhabitants, both new and old, take up arms to
              fight for the future. Will you stand with them? Assemble your
              armies and live out this legendary chapter of Warcraft’s history
              by purchasing Warcraft III: Reforged today.
